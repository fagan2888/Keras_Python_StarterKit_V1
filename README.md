# What is Keras?

Keras is a high-level neural networks API developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research. Keras has the following key features:

- Allows the same code to run on CPU or on GPU, seamlessly.

- User-friendly API which makes it easy to quickly prototype deep learning models.

- Built-in support for convolutional networks (for computer vision), recurrent networks (for sequence processing), and any combination of both.

Keras is capable of running on top of multiple back-ends including TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. For further information visit https://keras.io to learn on the Keras project.

This repositary is intended as a Keras Python Starter kit for beginners to play around.
